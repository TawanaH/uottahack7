**Project Description**  

Skej is an AI-powered schedule generator designed to make course registration effortless and stress-free. With Skej, you can generate at least three personalized, conflict-free schedules in just five minutes. Simply enter your mandatory courses, select a few electives, and even add special requests like "No class on Mondays." Accessibility is a core value, so you can also build schedules entirely with voice commands.  

Skej goes beyond just scheduling: click on a course to see details like the professor's RateMyProf score and course information, helping you make informed decisions. Once you’ve found the perfect schedule, copy the CRNs, and you’re ready to register!  

**Key Features:**  
- AI-powered for fast, hassle-free schedule generation.  
- Personalized options with flexible requests.  
- Accessibility through voice command support.  
- Integrated course details for better decision-making.  

With Skej, course scheduling at Carleton becomes as simple as entering your preferences and choosing the best fit!
